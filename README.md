# digital-recognition

 **📌 Project Overview: Handwritten Digit Recognition**  
This project focuses on **recognizing handwritten digits (0-9)** using **Deep Learning (CNN)**. It is based on the **MNIST dataset**, which contains thousands of handwritten digits.  

 **📌 What This Project Does**
1️⃣ **Trains a Deep Learning model** to recognize digits from images.  
2️⃣ **Tests the model** on handwritten digits.  
3️⃣ **Predicts digits** from user-input images.  
4️⃣ **Allows users to draw a digit** and get a prediction using a **GUI**.  


**📌 Applications of This Project**

✅ **Banking Systems:** Recognizing handwritten cheques.  
✅ **Digitized Exams:** Automatic scoring of handwritten answers.  
✅ **Postal Services:** Reading handwritten postal codes.  
✅ **Mobile Applications:** Converting handwritten numbers into digital text.  


 **📌 Possible Enhancements**
 
💡 Add **OpenCV** to recognize digits from camera images.  
💡 Create a **GUI** using **Tkinter or Streamlit** to allow users to draw digits.  
💡 Deploy it as a **web app using Flask**.  
💡 Improve accuracy by **training with a larger dataset**.
